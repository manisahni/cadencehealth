HEADLINE: "Find your rhythm in weight loss."
SUBTITLE: "Transform your health with the medical supervision you deserve"

THREE CORE VALUE PROPS:
1. Sustainable, Targeted Weight Loss
   - Significant, sustainable weight loss based on clinical trial protocols with personalized physician optimization.
   - Evidence-based protocols, not guesswork

2. Bi-Weekly MD Consultations
   - Hospital-trained physicians meeting with you every two weeks—not the single visit other telehealth offers.
   - Real medical care, not prescription refill service

3. Preserve Muscle During Weight Loss
   - Remote monitoring helps maintain lean muscle while losing fat—tracking body composition changes throughout your journey.
   - Lose fat, keep muscle - most services ignore this

VALUE COMPARISON BOX:
"Get Your Transformation Right the First Time"
Think we're expensive? Do the math: Clinical trials achieve 85% success rates with close medical supervision, while real-world patients see only 35% success without support (JAMA). Pill mills charge $100-150/month but when 65% quit within months from unmanaged side effects, they've wasted money plus medication costs. Our $299/month includes bi-weekly MD consultations matching clinical trial protocols—designed to bridge the gap between real-world failure and clinical trial success.

=================================================================================
SCIENCE SECTION
=================================================================================

HEADLINE: "The Science of Sustainable Transformation"
SUBTITLE: "360° monitoring optimizes your metabolic rhythm for lasting results"

THREE PILLARS:

   - Managing profound change safely

CLINICAL VS REAL WORLD BOX:
"Bridging the Gap: Clinical Trials vs Real World"
Clinical trials achieve 85% continuation rates with close supervision. Real-world patients see only 35% success without support (JAMA). Our bi-weekly monitoring aims to bring clinical trial success to real-world patients:
- Many reverse prediabetes (A1C normalized)
- Improved liver health (NASH reduction)
- Better insulin function (HOMA-IR tracking)
- -20% cardiovascular events (SELECT trial result)

=================================================================================
METHOD SECTION
=================================================================================

HEADLINE: "Our Method"
SUBTITLE: "Simple, effective, personalized."

THREE-STEP APPROACH:
1. Disease Risk Assessment
   - Evaluate diabetes, cardiovascular, stroke, kidney disease, and cancer risks
   - Track NASH/fatty liver improvement

2. Preserve Muscle Mass
   - Monitor muscle loss prevention while reducing visceral fat
   - Track insulin resistance reversal (HOMA-IR)

3. Prevent Complications
   - Early detection of kidney function changes, liver improvements, cardiovascular risk reduction
   - Weekly physician review

=================================================================================
WHY US SECTION
=================================================================================

HEADLINE: "The Truth About GLP-1 Weight Loss Programs"
SUBTITLE: "Before you choose any weight loss program, you deserve to know the facts. Here's what the evidence really shows—and why it matters for your success."

THREE EVIDENCE CARDS:

1. THE COMPOUNDED GLP-1 CRISIS
FDA Warnings Most Programs Ignore:
• Contamination risks in compounded versions
• Dosing errors causing severe side effects
• Fraudulent products with unknown ingredients
• No FDA oversight of compounding pharmacies
→ Cadence Health: We only prescribe FDA-approved Wegovy® and Zepbound™—never risky compounded versions.

2. THE 65% FAILURE RATE NOBODY MENTIONS
Real-World vs Marketing Claims:
• Clinical trials: 85% continue treatment
• Real world: 65% quit within 12 months (JAMA)
• Main reason: Unmanaged side effects
• Result: Weight regain + wasted money
→ Cadence Health: Targeting clinical trial success rates (85%) through bi-weekly physician monitoring.

3. THE HIDDEN DANGER: MUSCLE LOSS
What Happens Without Monitoring:
• 20-40% of weight lost can be lean muscle
• Slower metabolism from muscle loss
• Increased frailty risk especially over 50
• Weight regain more likely without muscle
→ Cadence Health: Body composition monitoring ensures you lose fat, not muscle—protecting your metabolism.

=================================================================================
PRICING SECTION
=================================================================================

HEADLINE: "Choose Your Monitoring Level"
SUBTITLE: "Same physician care, different depth of metabolic tracking"

BOTH PROGRAMS INCLUDE:
✓ Same consultation frequency
✓ Body composition (Withings scale)
✓ Text support with Dr. Sahni
✓ Medication management
✓ Weekly physician monitoring
✓ Dose optimization
(The only difference is the depth of lab data we track)

ESSENTIAL MONITORING:
Comprehensive care with standard labs
Phase 1: $249/mo (Months 1-6 Intensive)
Phase 2: $149/mo (Months 7-12 Stabilization)
Phase 3: $99/mo (Year 2+ Maintenance)

Standard Labs (usually covered):
• Complete blood count (CBC)
• Metabolic panel (kidney/liver)
• Lipid panel (cholesterol)
• A1C (diabetes screening)
• Thyroid (TSH)
• Basic nutritional markers
(Most insurance covers these labs with obesity diagnosis E66.9)

ADVANCED METABOLIC (RECOMMENDED):
Precision tracking with advanced biomarkers
Phase 1: $349/mo (Months 1-6 Intensive)
Phase 2: $249/mo (Months 7-12 Stabilization)
Phase 3: $149/mo (Year 2+ Maintenance)

Everything in Essential PLUS:
• Insulin & HOMA-IR (insulin resistance)
• ApoB (cardiovascular predictor)
• hsCRP (inflammation marker)
• Lp(a) (genetic risk)
• Advanced nutritional panel
• Hormone optimization markers
• Detailed metabolic reports
(Advanced labs ~$300/quarter, rarely covered. Ideal for prediabetes or family history)

WHY THIS PRICING STRUCTURE:
• Months 1-6: FDA-approved GLP-1 dosing requires gradual escalation over 4-6 months. Frequent monitoring prevents side effects and optimizes results.
• Months 7-12: Clinical trials show weight loss plateaus as the body adapts. Less frequent visits are appropriate as doses stabilize.
• Year 2+: Long-term maintenance requires ongoing support but minimal adjustments. Monthly check-ins maintain accountability.
(This evidence-based timeline aligns with how GLP-1 medications work, ensuring you get intensive support when you need it most.)

=================================================================================
KEY FAQ POINTS
=================================================================================

HOW IS THIS DIFFERENT FROM ONLINE-ONLY PROGRAMS?
We provide comprehensive medical care, not just prescriptions. Our program includes quarterly labs with inflammation markers (hsCRP), continuous body composition monitoring to ensure healthy fat-to-muscle ratios, nutritional assessments, and weekly review by Dr. Sahni. This level of medical oversight leads to better outcomes.

WILL INSURANCE COVER THE GLP-1 MEDICATION?
Coverage varies, but we fight for every patient. We handle prior authorizations, appeals, and work directly with your insurance. With good insurance: Often $0-50/month copay. Without insurance: Zepbound™ $349-$549/month, Wegovy® ~$499/month with GoodRx. We exclusively prescribe FDA-approved medications.

HOW MUCH WEIGHT WILL I LOSE?
Results vary. In clinical trials, patients lost 15–22% of their body weight over 12–18 months with lifestyle support. Most notice appetite changes within weeks, with steady progress as doses increase.

WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ESSENTIAL AND ADVANCED PROGRAMS?
Both programs include the same physician care, consultation frequency, body composition monitoring, and support. The only difference is the depth of lab data tracked. Essential includes standard labs (usually covered by insurance). Advanced adds specialized markers that cost ~$300/quarter and are rarely covered. Most patients do well with Essential.

WHY IS THIS A 6-MONTH INTENSIVE PROGRAM?
Our timeline aligns with standard GLP-1 treatment protocols. FDA-approved medications require gradual dose escalation over several months to minimize side effects and optimize results. Weight loss typically occurs most rapidly in the first 6 months, often followed by a plateau phase.
