# Web3Forms Setup - Quick Start Guide

## Why Web3Forms?
- âœ… **Works locally** - Test on localhost immediately
- âœ… **Free** - Unlimited form submissions
- âœ… **No account** - Just email verification
- âœ… **Simple** - 2-minute setup
- âœ… **Reliable** - Email notifications

## Step 1: Get Your Access Key (1 minute)

1. Go to https://web3forms.com
2. Enter your email address
3. Click "Get Access Key"
4. Check your email for the access key
5. Copy the access key (looks like: `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

## Step 2: Add Your Access Key (30 seconds)

1. Open `index.html`
2. Find line 1896: `const WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY = 'YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE';`
3. Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE` with your actual access key
4. Save the file

Example:
```javascript
const WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY = 'xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx';
```

## Step 3: Test Locally (1 minute)

1. Start your local server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
3. Fill out the consultation form:
   - Enter BMI info
   - Add name and email
   - Submit the form
4. Check your email - you should receive the submission!

## Step 4: Deploy (Optional)

Once tested locally:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Web3Forms for form handling"
git push origin main
```

If using Netlify, it will auto-deploy. Otherwise:
```bash
netlify deploy --prod
```

## What You'll Receive

Each form submission sends an email with:
- **Subject**: "New Consultation Request - Cadence Health"
- **Name**: The submitted name
- **Email**: The submitted email
- **Timestamp**: When submitted (EST/EDT)
- **Message**: Context about the submission

## Customization Options

You can add more fields in the `submitToWeb3Forms` function:

```javascript
const formData = {
    access_key: WEB3FORMS_ACCESS_KEY,
    name: name,
    email: email,
    phone: phone,  // Add phone field
    bmi: bmi,      // Add BMI data
    age: age,      // Add age
    // Any other fields you want
};
```

## Troubleshooting
