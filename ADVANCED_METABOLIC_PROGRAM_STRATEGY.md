# Advanced Metabolic Program Strategy
## Strategic Planning Document - Confidential
*Last Updated: December 6, 2024*

---

## Executive Summary

Transform Cadence Health from a weight loss clinic into a comprehensive metabolic health center by leveraging our existing patient base as a pipeline for advanced metabolic risk management. Weight loss patients naturally reveal metabolic risks that require ongoing management - creating a perfect upsell opportunity.

**Key Insight**: Our weight loss patients ARE high-risk metabolic patients - they just don't know it yet.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation (Current - Q1 2025)
### Build the Pipeline Without Revealing Full Strategy

### 1.1 Add High-Value Screenings to Current Programs
**Immediate additions (cheap but powerful):**
- **Lp(a)** - One-time genetic test (~$50) - catches 20% of population at high risk
- **CAC score referral** - If indicated (~$100-200) - gold standard for disease
- **ASCVD 10-year risk** - Free calculation, validates statin need
- **Metabolic age** - Motivational tool showing improvement
- **Visceral Adiposity Index** - Better than BMI for metabolic risk

### 1.2 Subtle Website Updates
**Add without mentioning ethnicities or full program:**
- "Coming Soon: Advanced Metabolic Risk Management" banner
- "Future Programs" section in About page
- FAQ: "Specialized programs for high-risk individuals coming Spring 2025"
- Assessment form: Add family history questions for data collection

### 1.3 Patient Identification System
**Screening questions to add:**
- Family history of early heart disease (<55 men, <65 women)
- Family history of diabetes
- Ethnic background (dropdown - for data only)
- History of high cholesterol
- PCOS or gestational diabetes history

**This creates a database of high-risk patients for later targeting**

---

## Phase 2: Soft Launch (Q2 2025)
### Test Advanced Program with Select Patients

### 2.1 Target Patient Profiles
**Tier 1 (Immediate converts):**
- Current weight loss patients with:
  - Prediabetes (A1C 5.7-6.4)
  - Elevated Lp(a)
  - Strong family history
  - Multiple risk factors

**Tier 2 (Direct enrollment):**
- South Asians with metabolic risk
- Young diabetics (<45 years)
- Lean NAFLD patients
- PCOS with metabolic syndrome

### 2.2 Conversion Messaging Timeline

**Month 3 of Weight Loss:**
"Your weight loss is progressing well, but we've identified some important metabolic risks that need ongoing management..."

**Month 6 (Transition point):**
"You've achieved significant weight loss. Based on your risk factors, I recommend our new Advanced Metabolic Management program..."

**Graduation Pitch:**
"Weight loss was step one. Now let's focus on preventing the diabetes/heart disease that runs in your family..."

## Financial Projections

### Current State (Weight Loss Only)
- 100 patients × $250/month average = $25,000/month
- Natural attrition after weight loss = revenue decline

### With Advanced Metabolic (Year 1)
- 50 weight loss patients × $250 = $12,500
- 30 converts to metabolic × $350 = $10,500
- 20 direct metabolic × $500 = $10,000
- **Total: $33,000/month (32% increase)**

### Scaled Model (Year 2)
- 100 weight loss × $250 = $25,000
- 75 metabolic core × $350 = $26,250
- 25 premium × $500 = $12,500
- 10 executive × $1,000 = $10,000
- **Total: $73,750/month (195% increase)**

---

## Marketing Strategy

### Phase 1: Subtle Introduction
- "Hidden risk factors we uncover"
- "Beyond weight loss"
- "Comprehensive metabolic health"

### Phase 2: Risk Education
- Blog posts: "Why Lp(a) matters more than cholesterol"
- Webinars: "Family history and your metabolic future"
- Case studies: "Found prediabetes at BMI 26"

### Phase 3: Targeted Campaigns
- South Asian community centers (later)
- Young professional organizations
- Executive health programs
- Concierge medicine networks

## Risk Factors & Mitigation

### Risks:
1. **Patients see it as upsell**: Position as medical necessity, not sales
2. **Competition from primary care**: Emphasize specialization
3. **Insurance expectations**: Clear cash-pay value proposition
4. **Scope creep**: Stay focused on metabolic, not primary care

### Mitigation:
1. **Education-first approach**: Show risk data, let patients decide
2. **Outcome tracking**: Prove value with improved biomarkers
3. **Gradual rollout**: Test with willing patients first
4. **Clear boundaries**: Metabolic only, refer other issues

---

## Key Success Metrics

### Phase 1 (Pipeline Building):
- % of weight loss patients with identified risks: Target 60%
- Family history data collection: Target 80% completion
- Lp(a) testing uptake: Target 40%

### Phase 2 (Conversion):
- Weight loss → Metabolic conversion: Target 30%
- Direct enrollment: Target 10-20 patients
- Retention rate: Target 85% at 6 months

### Phase 3 (Scale):
- Total metabolic patients: Target 100
- Revenue per patient: Target $400/month
- Clinical outcomes: 50% improvement in key markers
