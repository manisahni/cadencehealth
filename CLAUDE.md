- **Text Secondary**: `#777` - Light gray for supporting text
- **Accent**: `#6366f1` - Indigo (used sparingly for highlights)

### Button Colors
- **Primary Button Background**: `#1a1a1a` - Near black
- **Primary Button Text**: `#ffffff` - Pure white
- **Button Hover**: `#333` - Lighter black
- **Button Shadow**: `rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15)` - Subtle depth

### Borders & Dividers
- **Border Color**: `rgba(45, 45, 45, 0.06)` - Very subtle borders
- **Divider**: `#e5e5e5` - Light gray for form underlines
- **Input Underline**: `#ddd` → `#e5e5e5` (even softer)

### FAQ Content Structure

#### Quick FAQ (Overview Section)
Three cards displayed on the Overview tab for immediate answers to top concerns:
1. **Is this covered by insurance?** - Coverage varies by plan. Many require prior authorization. Our $149/month cash price often beats copays, with no delays or denials.
2. **How much weight will I lose?** - Clinical trials show 15-22% body weight loss over 12-18 months. Most notice appetite changes within weeks.
3. **Why do I need a physician?** - GLP-1s are powerful. With MD guidance, you get safe dosing, side effect management, and better success rates.

#### Full FAQ (Accordion on FAQ Tab)
**Top 3 Questions (Expanded by Default):**
1. **Is this covered by insurance?**
   - Coverage depends on your plan. Many insurers require prior authorization and certain criteria (BMI + health conditions). Medicare usually only covers GLP-1s for diabetes, not weight loss. Medicaid coverage is very limited. If not covered, we'll guide you to cash-pay programs like Wegovy® (~$499/month) and Zepbound™ ($349–$499/month). Our $149 monthly fee covers all physician services.

2. **How much weight will I lose?**
   - Results vary, but clinical trials with lifestyle support show 15–22% body weight loss over 12–18 months. Most people notice appetite changes within a few weeks, with steady progress as doses increase. Your physician will optimize your dosing based on your individual response and tolerance.

3. **Why do I need a physician?**
   - GLP-1s are powerful medications that affect multiple organ systems. Without medical guidance, many people stop early due to side effects or access issues. With physician-led care, you get safe dose titration, side-effect management, and lab monitoring when needed—improving both safety and success rates from 30% to over 87%.

**Additional Questions (Collapsed by Default):**
- What is prior authorization (PA)?
- What if my insurance denies coverage?
- Do I need lab tests?
- How will follow-ups work?
- What if I miss a dose?
- Can I use GoodRx or compounding pharmacies?
- What if my pharmacy is out of stock?

## Version Control
- Commit message format: "Component: Brief description"
- Always test responsive design before committing
- Keep experimental designs in separate HTML files
- Document significant style changes in commit messages

## Netlify Deployment & Troubleshooting

### 🚀 Deployment Architecture

#### Normal Flow
1. **Local changes** → `git add` → `git commit` → `git push origin main`
2. **GitHub webhook** → Triggers Netlify build
3. **Netlify auto-deploy** → Updates live site
4. **Live URL**: https://cadencehealth.netlify.app

#### Key Configuration
- **Main file**: `index.html` (confirmed by `netlify.toml` redirect)
- **Publish directory**: `.` (root directory)
- **Build command**: None (static HTML)
- **Repository**: https://github.com/manisahni/cadencehealth.git

### ⚠️ Common Deployment Issues

#### Issue: Changes Not Deploying (September 2025 Case Study)
**Symptoms:**
- Local files updated correctly ✅
- Changes committed and pushed to GitHub ✅  
- Live site serving old content ❌

**Root Causes:**
- Netlify auto-deployment failure (silent)
- GitHub webhook disconnection
- Netlify build cache issues
- Branch mismatch in Netlify settings

**Solution Hierarchy:**
1. **Force manual deployment**: `netlify deploy --prod`
2. **Check Netlify dashboard**: Look for failed builds
3. **Clear Netlify cache**: If available in dashboard
4. **Verify GitHub connection**: Ensure correct repo/branch

### 🛠️ Troubleshooting Workflow

#### Step 1: Verify Local Changes
```bash
# Check specific changes exist locally
grep -n "your-change" index.html
```

#### Step 2: Verify Git Status  
```bash
# Check commits are pushed
git status
git log --oneline -3
```

#### Step 3: Test Live Site
```bash
# Check if changes are live
curl -s https://cadencehealth.netlify.app/ | grep "your-change"
```

#### Step 4: Force Deploy (if needed)
```bash
# Manual deployment via CLI
netlify status  # Verify connection
netlify deploy --prod  # Force fresh deployment
```

#### Step 5: Verification
```bash
# Wait 30 seconds, then verify
sleep 30
curl -s https://cadencehealth.netlify.app/ | grep "your-change"
```

### 📋 Deployment Checklist

Before considering a deployment "complete":
- [ ] Local changes tested and committed
- [ ] Changes pushed to GitHub successfully
- [ ] Live site checked for updates (don't assume!)
- [ ] Form functionality tested (if form changes made)
- [ ] Critical user paths verified working

### 🔧 Netlify CLI Setup

#### Installation & Authentication
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI globally
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to your Netlify account  
netlify login

# Link to project (run in project directory)
netlify link --id 85c63b0d-534b-46db-aac2-3b0b2a8a23f7
```

#### Essential Commands
```bash
netlify status          # Check connection & project info
netlify deploy --prod   # Force production deployment  
netlify open            # Open project in browser
netlify env:list       # Check environment variables
```

### 🚨 Critical Lessons Learned

#### Never Assume Deployment Worked
- **Bad**: Push code → assume it's live
- **Good**: Push code → verify it's live → test functionality

#### Keep CLI as Backup
- GitHub integration can fail silently
- Manual deployment via CLI bypasses webhook issues
- Always have `netlify-cli` installed and authenticated

#### Document Recurring Issues
- If deployment fails twice, document the pattern
- Note specific error messages for future reference
- Update this troubleshooting guide with new solutions

### 📝 Historical Issues Log

#### September 5, 2025: Auto-Deployment Failure
- **Issue**: Phone number removal and FAQ reordering not deploying
- **Duration**: ~45 minutes of debugging
- **Root Cause**: Netlify auto-deployment stuck/failing silently
- **Solution**: `netlify deploy --prod` worked immediately
- **Prevention**: Always verify deployment with curl test

*Add new issues here to build institutional knowledge*

## Local Development Environment

### 🏗️ Development Philosophy

**ALWAYS develop and test locally before pushing to production!**

- **Bad**: Edit code → Git push → Hope it works on live site
- **Good**: Edit code → Test locally → Verify functionality → Git push → Deploy

### 🚀 Quick Start

#### Method 1: Node.js Live Server (Recommended)
```bash
# Start development server with auto-reload
npm run dev
# Opens http://localhost:3000 automatically
```

#### Method 2: Python Simple Server (Backup)
```bash
# Start simple HTTP server (no auto-reload)
npm run serve
# Manual navigation to http://localhost:8000
```

### 📋 Available Development Commands

```bash
npm run dev      # Start dev server (no browser auto-open)
npm run start    # Start dev server with browser auto-open
npm run preview  # Start server with overview.html (development file)
npm run serve    # Python fallback server
```

### 🎯 Development Workflow

#### Step 1: Start Local Server
```bash
cd /Users/nish_macbook/glp-clinic-website
npm run dev
```

#### Step 2: Make Changes
- Edit `index.html`, CSS, or JavaScript
- Changes auto-reload in browser (with live-server)
- Test all functionality locally

#### Step 3: Test Critical Paths
- **Form Assessment Flow**: BMI calculator → Basic info → Safety checks
- **FAQ Interaction**: Accordion expand/collapse
- **Responsive Design**: Test mobile/desktop layouts
- **Form Validation**: Test required fields

#### Step 4: Deploy When Ready
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Description of changes"
git push origin main
# If auto-deploy fails: netlify deploy --prod
```

### 🔧 Form Development Strategy

#### Local Form Testing Limitation
**Issue**: Netlify Forms (`data-netlify="true"`) only work in production
**Solution**: Test form structure locally, functionality in production

#### Local Testing Checklist
- [ ] Form fields display correctly
- [ ] Required field validation works
- [ ] Assessment flow logic functions
- [ ] Form styling matches design
- [ ] All form steps are accessible

#### Production Form Testing
Use Netlify Deploy Preview for actual form submission testing:
```bash
netlify deploy  # Creates preview URL for testing
```

### 🐛 Local Development Troubleshooting

#### Common Issues

**Port Already in Use**
```bash
# Find process using port 3000
lsof -i :3000
# Kill the process
kill -9 <PID>
```

**Live-server Not Found**
```bash
# Reinstall globally
npm install -g live-server
```

**Form Doesn't Work Locally**
- **Expected**: Forms won't submit locally (Netlify dependency)
- **Solution**: Test form structure locally, submission in production/preview

### 🎨 File Development Priorities

#### Primary Development File
- **index.html** - Main production file served by Netlify
- Always test changes in this file locally

#### Secondary Files
- **overview.html** - Development/experimental file
- Use `npm run preview` to test overview.html changes

### 📁 Development File Structure
```
glp-clinic-website/
├── index.html          # Primary production file
├── overview.html       # Development/experimental
├── package.json        # Development scripts
├── netlify.toml        # Netlify configuration
├── CLAUDE.md           # Project documentation
└── thank-you.html      # Form success page
```

### 🚨 Before Every Git Push

#### Pre-Deployment Checklist
- [ ] **Tested locally**: All changes work on localhost
- [ ] **Critical paths verified**: Form flow, navigation, responsive design
- [ ] **No console errors**: Check browser dev tools
- [ ] **Form structure intact**: All required fields present
- [ ] **Content accurate**: No typos or formatting issues

#### Git Workflow
```bash
# 1. Test locally first
npm run dev

# 2. Verify everything works
# Test forms, navigation, responsive design

# 3. Commit with descriptive message
git add .
git commit -m "Specific description of what changed"

# 4. Push to production
git push origin main

# 5. Verify deployment (wait 1-2 minutes)
curl -s https://cadencehealth.netlify.app/ | grep "your-change"

# 6. If deployment failed, force deploy
netlify deploy --prod
```

This workflow prevents deployment issues and ensures professional development practices.

## 📚 Project Change Log & Institutional Memory

### September 6, 2025: Selection-Based Positioning Transformation

#### Strategic Pivot
**From**: Sales-focused "get a consultation" approach  
**To**: Selection-based "apply for founding cohort" positioning

#### Changes Made
1. **Pricing Model Transformation**
   - Old: $249 initial consultation + $199 follow-up visits
   - New: $299/month intensive (months 1-6) → $199/month stabilization (months 7-12) → $99/month maintenance (year 2+)
   - Framing: "$1,800 investment" in transformation vs per-visit fees
   
2. **Founding Cohort Positioning**
   - Limited to 100 patients with Dr. Sahni personally managing care
   - 1:100 physician-to-patient ratio for quality
   - "Current cohort forming" vs "limited time offer"
   
3. **Selection Criteria Section Added**
   - "This Program IS For You If" - commitment indicators
   - "This Program is NOT For You If" - wrong fit indicators
   - Professional filtering vs selling to everyone
   
4. **Application Process Language**
   - "Expression of Interest" instead of "Apply Now"
   - "Submit Application" instead of "Request Consultation"
   - "We'll review and contact qualified candidates" positioning

5. **Investment Mindset Messaging**
   - "Most important investment of your adult life"
   - Comparison to disease costs ($13K/year diabetes, $20K+ heart disease)
   - Prevention investment vs expense framing

#### Lessons Learned
- **Selection Creates Desire**: Exclusive positioning more powerful than sales pressure
- **Commitment as Filter**: $299/month + 6-month minimum selects serious patients
- **No Cheesy Guarantees**: Professional medical program, not weight loss product
- **Graduation Concept**: Phases create journey with clear progression
- **Investment Psychology**: Higher price = higher perceived value + commitment

#### Strategic Rationale
- Higher commitment leads to better patient outcomes
- Selection approach attracts motivated patients
- Personal management by Dr. Sahni justifies premium pricing
- Phased approach provides clear transformation journey
- Professional positioning differentiates from pill mills

### September 9, 2025: Major Messaging Overhaul

#### Changes Made
1. **Physician Messaging Refinement**
   - Problem: Repetitive "board-certified MD" felt forced
   - Solution: Varied terminology (physician, medical supervision, real doctors)
   - Result: More natural, readable content
   
2. **Disease Prevention Focus**
   - Added: Diabetes, prediabetes, NASH, cardiovascular, stroke, kidney, cancer risk
   - Initial approach: Used specific statistics (68% prediabetes reversal, 39% NASH)
   - Rationale: Specific health outcomes > generic "weight loss"

3. **Pricing Corrections**
   - Fixed: FAQ pricing ($149/$149 → $249/$199)
   - Standardized: Zepbound pricing ($349-$549/month)
   - Removed: Duplicate "pill mills" FAQ entry

4. **Health Monitoring Reframe**
   - Old: Generic categories (Metabolic, Cardiovascular, Safety)
   - New: Condition-specific (Diabetes & NASH Prevention, Heart Attack & Stroke Risk)
   - Impact: Clearer value proposition for patients

5. **Evidence-Based Claims Revision (CRITICAL)**
   - Problem: Used synthesized statistics without proper study citations
   - Examples: "68% reverse prediabetes", "52% insulin resistance", "39% liver fat"
   - Risk: Legal liability, credibility damage, medical marketing violations
   - Solution: Conservative language, study citations, conditional terms
   - Result: Legally appropriate, more credible messaging

#### Lessons Learned
- **Messaging**: Natural language variation improves readability
- **Specificity**: Name conditions explicitly (NASH, not "liver health")
- **Evidence Standards**: Never use specific percentages without study citations
- **Medical Claims**: Conditional language essential ("may help" not "will cure")
- **Credibility**: Conservative claims build more trust than inflated ones

## 🏥 Medical Marketing Best Practices

### Evidence-Based Claims Standards

**CRITICAL**: All health claims must be backed by credible evidence and use appropriate conditional language.

#### Evidence Hierarchy for Health Claims
1. **Established (Use freely)**: FDA-approved outcomes, major RCTs with clear results
   - Example: "20% cardiovascular event reduction (SELECT trial)"
   - Language: "Clinical trials demonstrate"

2. **Well-Supported (Use with study citation)**: Meta-analyses, large peer-reviewed trials
   - Example: "15-20% weight loss (STEP trials)"
   - Language: "Studies show", "Research demonstrates"

3. **Emerging (Use "studies suggest")**: Small trials, observational data, preliminary research
   - Example: "Studies suggest GLP-1s may benefit NASH"
   - Language: "Research suggests", "Preliminary studies indicate"

4. **Synthesized (Avoid specifics)**: Our analysis, industry estimates, synthesized data
   - Example: "Many patients see A1C improvement"
   - Language: "Many", "Some", "Patients may experience"

#### Safe Language Patterns
- ✅ "Clinical trials demonstrate" vs ❌ "Studies prove"
- ✅ "May help reduce" vs ❌ "Reduces" or "Will reduce"
- ✅ "Many patients see" vs ❌ "Patients see" or "All patients"
- ✅ "Research suggests" vs ❌ "Research proves"
- ✅ "Individual results vary" vs ❌ "Guaranteed results"

#### Required Medical Disclaimers
- Individual results may vary
- These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA
- This is not medical advice (where appropriate)
- Consult your physician before starting treatment
- Results from clinical trials may not reflect typical outcomes

### Content Audit Protocol

#### Before Publishing Any Health Claim
1. **Source Check**: Can I cite a specific, credible study?
2. **Language Check**: Am I using conditional terms appropriately?
3. **Disclaimer Check**: Are individual result variations noted?
4. **Legal Check**: Would this pass medical marketing compliance review?
5. **Credibility Check**: Does this build or undermine professional trust?

#### Red Flags to Avoid
- Exact percentages without study citation
- Absolute benefit claims ("will prevent", "cures", "eliminates")
- Comparison claims without evidence ("better than competitors")
- Guaranteed outcome language ("guaranteed results")
- FDA-like approval claims without actual FDA approval

#### Green Flags to Include
- Named study references (SELECT, STEP, SURMOUNT trials)
- Conditional language throughout
- Individual variation disclaimers
- Professional, measured tone
- Focus on monitoring vs promising outcomes

## 🎯 Content Strategy & Design Patterns

### Messaging Hierarchy (Evidence-Based)
1. **Evidence-Based Prevention**: Lead with study-backed claims
   - "Clinical trials demonstrate diabetes prevention" > "We prevent diabetes"
2. **Named Trial Results**: Cite specific studies when possible
   - "SELECT trial: 20% cardiovascular reduction" > "Reduces heart disease risk"
3. **Conditional Benefits**: Use "may help" language consistently
   - "May help reverse prediabetes" > "Reverses prediabetes"
4. **Professional Monitoring**: Emphasize tracking vs guaranteeing outcomes
   - "Monitor your A1C improvement" > "Guarantee A1C improvement"

### Page Section Strategy
- **Hero**: Biggest health fear (diabetes prevention)
- **Science**: Back up with clinical statistics
- **Method**: Show medical rigor
- **Pricing**: Frame as prevention investment
- **FAQ**: Address specific health concerns

### Health Claims Guidelines
- Always cite "studies show" or "clinical trials"
- Use ranges for statistics (15-20%, not 17.3%)
- Include biomarkers (HOMA-IR, hsCRP)
- Say "may reduce" not "will prevent"
- Emphasize monitoring over guarantees

### Pricing Philosophy
- Lead with value (prevention savings)
- Separate service fees from medication costs
- Emphasize physician expertise
- Compare to complication costs
- Transparent about cash-pay model

## 🎯 Selection-Based Marketing Framework (Added Sept 6, 2025)

### Core Philosophy
**We select patients; we don't sell to them.**

### Selection Criteria Messaging
#### "This Program IS For You If:"
- Framework for identifying ideal patients
- Focus on commitment and readiness
- Medical necessity (BMI ≥ 30)
- Investment mindset (prevention > treatment)
- 6-month minimum commitment ability
- Weekly consultation availability

#### "This Program is NOT For You If:"
- Clear disqualifiers upfront
- Sets professional boundaries
- Filters out price shoppers
- Excludes quick-fix seekers
- Removes non-compliant patients

### Application vs Sales Process
| Traditional Sales | Selection-Based |
|------------------|-----------------|
| "Apply Now!" | "Expression of Interest" |
| "Limited Time Offer" | "Current Cohort Forming" |
| "Get Started Today" | "Submit Application" |
| "Free Consultation" | "Application Review" |
| "Money-Back Guarantee" | "Commitment Requirements" |

### Scarcity Through Quality
- Limited by physician capacity (1:100 ratio)
- Not artificial scarcity
- Quality over quantity positioning
- Personal management justification

### Investment Psychology
- $299/month creates commitment device
- Higher price = higher perceived value
- Self-selection of motivated patients
- Prevention investment vs expense
- Comparison to disease management costs

### Professional Positioning Language
- "Medical program" not "weight loss service"
- "Treatment protocol" not "plan"
- "Metabolic transformation" not "diet"
- "Founding cohort" not "first customers"
- "Graduate" not "complete"

- **Skepticism**: Wary of online pill mills but want convenience
- **Values**: Safety, efficacy, expertise, long-term health

#### Core Concerns Hierarchy
1. **Safety**: "Will this damage my body? What about muscle loss?"
2. **Sustainability**: "Will the weight come back when I stop?"
3. **Quality**: "Am I getting real medicine or cheap knockoffs?"
4. **Value**: "Is $249 worth it vs $50 online options?"

### 2. Message Architecture Process

#### Weakness Analysis Template
- **Generic Claims**: What everyone else says (identify to avoid)
- **Vague Benefits**: Non-specific advantages (make concrete)
- **Repeated Info**: Redundant messages across sections (eliminate)

#### Strength Identification
- **Unique Angles**: What only we can credibly claim
- **Specific Benefits**: Quantifiable, measurable outcomes
- **Brand Integration**: Tie to "rhythm/cadence" concept

### 3. Competitive Differentiation Matrix

| What Others Say | What We Should Say | Why It's Better |
