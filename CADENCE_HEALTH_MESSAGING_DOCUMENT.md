## 5. FAQ Content (Objection Handling)

### Top 3 Questions (Most Critical)

#### 1. "Is this covered by insurance?"
**Quick Answer**: Coverage varies by plan. Many require prior authorization. Our $149/month cash price often beats copays, with no delays or denials.

**Full Answer**: Coverage depends on your plan. Many insurers require prior authorization and certain criteria (BMI + health conditions). Medicare usually only covers GLP-1s for diabetes, not weight loss. Medicaid coverage is very limited. If not covered, we'll guide you to cash-pay programs like Wegovy® (~$499/month) and Zepbound™ ($349–$499/month). Our $249 initial consultation/$199 follow-up fees cover all physician services.

#### 2. "How much weight will I lose?"
**Quick Answer**: Clinical trials show 15-22% body weight loss over 12-18 months. Most notice appetite changes within weeks.

**Full Answer**: Results vary, but clinical trials with lifestyle support show 15–22% body weight loss over 12–18 months. Most people notice appetite changes within a few weeks, with steady progress as doses increase. Your physician will optimize your dosing based on your individual response and tolerance.

#### 3. "Why do I need a physician?"
**Quick Answer**: GLP-1s are powerful. With MD guidance, you get safe dosing, side effect management, and better success rates.

**Full Answer**: GLP-1s are powerful medications that affect multiple organ systems. Without medical guidance, many people stop early due to side effects or access issues. With physician-led care, you get safe dose titration, side-effect management, and lab monitoring when needed—improving both safety and success rates from 30% to over 87%.

### Additional FAQ Topics
- What is prior authorization (PA)?
- What if my insurance denies coverage?
- Do I need lab tests?
- How will follow-ups work?
- What if I miss a dose?
- Can I use GoodRx or compounding pharmacies?
- What if my pharmacy is out of stock?
